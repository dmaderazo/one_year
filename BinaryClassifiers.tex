\section{Optimal Combination of Binary Classifiers}
    A binary classification is the process of predicting whether an element belongs two one of two sets, based on some kind of characteristic. In the context of bioinformatics, there is a desire to be able to classify objects of interest. For example, we may wish to classify the segments obtained through change point as TFBS or not. In the absence of a gold-standard data set, we proceed by using a method proposed by Keith et al. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We have some binary classifiers
        \item We want to combine them
        \item What is the best way?
        \item (Probably the union)
        \item ASSUMPTION: Conditional independence
        \item Dunno how strong the assumption of conditonal indep. is. When it gets violated, it doesn't seem to be too much of a problem.
        \item 
    \end{itemize}
