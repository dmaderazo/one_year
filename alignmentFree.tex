Two main types of alignment free methods.

\subsection{Frequency based methods}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Start with two query sequences $x$ and $y$.  
    \item Select word size of length $k$.
    \item Produce collections of \emph{unique} words that are present in each sequence. Call them $W_k^x$ and $W_k^y$.
    \item Let $W = W_k^x \cup W_k^y$
    \itme For each sequence let $c_k^x$ count the number of times that a particular word appears in sequence $x$ (resp. $y$).
    \item Calculate $d(c_k^x,c_k^y)$ with choice of metric.
